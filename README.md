# PGDeltaStream
A library that you can use to stream and ack changes from postgres. 
The changes are received back on a channel. You can ack LSNs asynchronously. 

Originally this was a webserver I found [here](https://github.com/hasura/pgdeltastream)
## Contributing
This library is a fork and modification from the server https://github.com/hasura/pgdeltastream 
Not looking for any contributions unless I make it stable.
